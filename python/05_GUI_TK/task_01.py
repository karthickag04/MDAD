# Task 1: Basic Menu Creation
# Create a basic window with a menu bar containing "File" and "Edit" menus. Each menu should have at least three items 
# (e.g., "New", "Open", "Save" for File, and "Cut", "Copy", "Paste" for Edit).

# Task 2: Submenus
# Create a submenu under the "File" menu called "Recent Files" that lists a few dummy filenames. Ensure that the submenu 
# appears when the "File" menu is hovered over.

# Task 3: Menu Commands
# Add functionality to the menu items. For example, when "Open" is clicked under the "File" menu, open a file dialog to 
# select a file. Display the selected file's path in a label on the main window.

# Task 4: Checkbutton Menu Items
# Create a menu that contains checkbutton items. For example, create a "View" menu with options to toggle "Show Toolbar" 
# and "Show Status Bar". Display the state of these options in the main window.

# Task 5: Radiobutton Menu Items
# Create a "Themes" menu with radiobutton items for different themes (e.g., "Light", "Dark", "Blue"). When a theme is selected, 
# change the window's background color accordingly.

# Task 6: Dynamic Menus
# Create a dynamic menu that updates based on user input. For example, have a "Favorites" menu that initially contains no items, 
# but allows the user to add new items via an entry field and a button.

# Task 7: Cascading Menus
# Create a cascading menu where one menu item leads to another submenu. For example, under the "Help" menu, add an "About" submenu 
# with items like "Version Info", "License", and "Contact Us".

# Task 8: Context Menus
# Create a context menu (right-click menu) that appears when the user right-clicks on a specific widget (e.g., a text box). The context 
# menu should have options like "Cut", "Copy", and "Paste".

# Task 9: Icons in Menus
# Add icons to the menu items. For example, include small icons next to "New", "Open", and "Save" in the "File" menu to enhance the 
# visual appeal.

# Task 10: Keyboard Shortcuts
# Assign keyboard shortcuts to menu items. For example, use "Ctrl+N" for "New", "Ctrl+O" for "Open", and "Ctrl+S" for "Save". Ensure 
# that the shortcuts are displayed next to the menu items and are functional.
