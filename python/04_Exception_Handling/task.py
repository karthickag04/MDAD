# Task 1: Division by zero
# Write a function that attempts to divide a number by zero. Handle the ZeroDivisionError.

# Task 2: Index error
# Write a function that tries to access an element from a list at an index that is out of range. Handle the IndexError.

# Task 3: Key error
# Write a function that tries to access a dictionary using a key that does not exist. Handle the KeyError.

# Task 4: Type error
# Write a function that attempts an operation (e.g., arithmetic) between incompatible types (e.g., string and integer). Handle the TypeError.

# Task 5: File not found
# Write a function that tries to open a file that does not exist. Handle the FileNotFoundError.

# Task 6: Value error
# Write a function that converts a user-inputted string to an integer and handles the ValueError if the input is not a valid integer.

# Task 7: Attribute error
# Write a function that tries to access an attribute of an object that does not exist. Handle the AttributeError.

# Task 8: Import error
# Write a script that tries to import a module that does not exist. Handle the ImportError.

# Task 9: Keyboard interrupt
# Write a script that takes user input in a loop and exits gracefully when the user interrupts the program (e.g., with Ctrl+C). Handle the KeyboardInterrupt.

# Task 10: Assertion error
# Write a function that takes an integer as input and raises an AssertionError if the integer is negative.

# Task 11: Overflow error
# Write a function that performs an arithmetic operation that results in a number too large to be represented. Handle the OverflowError.

# Task 12: Value error with int() function
# Write a function that tries to convert a string to an integer using the int() function and handles the ValueError.

# Task 13: Type error with open() function
# Write a function that tries to open a file with a mode that is not a string. Handle the TypeError.

# Task 14: JSON decode error
# Write a function that tries to decode an invalid JSON string and handles the JSONDecodeError (requires import json).

# Task 15: Runtime error
# Write a function that has a logical error causing it to enter an infinite loop. Handle the RuntimeError.

# Task 16: Custom error handling
# Define a custom exception class (e.g., CustomError) and write a function that raises this exception under a certain condition. Handle this custom exception in another function.

# Task 17: Multiple exceptions
# Write a function that performs several operations (e.g., arithmetic, accessing list elements) that can raise different types of exceptions. Handle each type of exception separately.

# Task 18: Using else and finally
# Modify some of the previous tasks to include else and finally blocks to execute specific code when no exceptions occur and to ensure cleanup code is executed regardless of exceptions.

# Task 19: Chaining exceptions
# Write a function that raises a new exception (NewException) with the original exception (OriginalException) as its cause. Handle and chain these exceptions appropriately.

# Task 20: Handling exceptions in a loop
# Write a script that iterates over a list of numbers, tries to perform an operation that may raise an exception on each iteration, and handles the exceptions without terminating the loop prematurely.
